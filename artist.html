            "I never had talent for art, but I have passion. Everyone can be an artist as long as they have passion and perseverance. Art must be fun and not a competition; enjoy what you do and love what you create."

            "I have always looked up at art since I was young and strived and worked to improve myself. Learning and creating is always a process; the result will always be a good feeling when you have worked for it, especially when you see how far you've come and realize that every brushstroke, sketch, and mistake has shaped you into the artist you are today."
